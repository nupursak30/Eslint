# Some comparable tools

Before ESLint came into existance, there were some popular tools available for linting namely JSlint, JSHint, JSCS etc. <br/>

### 1. JSLint and JSHint: 
JSLint Came in 2002 and JSHint is originated from JSLint project in 2010. ESLint came in 2013.

| Feature           | JSLint       | JSHint      |  ESLint   |
| :---              |     :---     |     :---    | :---      |
| Pre-Configured    | Yes          | Yes         | Yes       |
| Disable Rules     | Limited      | All         | All       |
| Add Custome Rules | No           | No          |  Yes      |
| Documentation     | Poor         | Rich        |  Rich     |
| Easy to Understand| No           | No          | Definitely|

### 2. JSCS : 
It is different from JSLint and JSHint. JSCS only checks the coding style and failed to check potential bugs/errors.

| Feature           | JSCS        |   ESLint |
| :---              |:---         |     :--- |
| Pre-Configured    | Yes         | Yes      |
| Disable Rules     | Yes         | Yes      |
| Catches errors    | Limited     | All      |
| Add Custome Rules | Yes         | Yes      |
| Documentation     | Poor        | Rich     |
| Easy to Understand| Yes         | Yes      |

JSCS is now merged with ESLint
